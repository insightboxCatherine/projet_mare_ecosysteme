User Guide for the Pond Ecosystem Simulation

Welcome to the dynamic pond ecosystem simulation! 
This guide explains how to interact with the simulation and make the most of its features.

1. Starting the Simulation
	Click the "Start" button to begin the simulation.
	Use the sliders to set the initial parameters:
	Plants: Adjust the starting number of plants in the pond.
	Fish: Choose the number of fish at the beginning of the simulation.
	Herons: Set the number of herons to include in the ecosystem.
	Years: Select the number of years to simulate.

2. During the Simulation
	Once started, the simulation displays plants, fish, and herons in the pond.
	Each species population will evolve based on growth, reproduction, and predation.
	The results panel on the right updates in real time to show the current populations.

3. Viewing Results
	Click the "Show Graph" button to display a graph of the population dynamics over time.
	The graph includes:
		Plants (green): The base resource of the ecosystem.
		Fish (blue): The intermediate consumers.
		Herons (brown): The top predators.

4. Additional Controls
	The entities (plants, fish, and herons) in the pond are represented as icons, showing their current positions.
	Each simulated year is displayed briefly to allow observation of population changes in real-time.
	Press ESC during the graph view to return to the main simulation.

5. Tips for a Better Experience
	Experiment with different parameters by running multiple simulations to explore how changes affect the ecosystem.
	Observe the balance between resource availability (plants) and the needs of consumers (fish and herons).
	Have fun exploring the fascinating dynamics of this aquatic ecosystem! If you have any questions, refer to this guide or experiment with the controls to discover more.
